### Data Science Projects

**Analyzing the Impact of Social Inequality on COVID-19 Vaccination Rates in the US**

[//]: # (<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>)

Our team worked on analyzing how social inequality impacts COVID-19 vaccination rates in the US. By collecting data from multiple sources and testing 3 different models, we were able to determine that the Random Forest Regressor was the most accurate model to predict vaccination rates. We discussed how these findings can be used to provide better care to specific communities.

**Rock Paper Scissors League**

Our team created a statistics website for a hypothetical Rock Paper Scissors League. This product included developing a relational database, making a database in MySQL, using Python Flask as the backend, and AppSmith for the front end. Gained experience with Docker containers and Mockaroo for mock data.

### Research Projects
**Development of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosensor to monitor kidney and liver damage in a zebrafish model of diabetes** 

Worked with research mentor in Wells Center for Pediatric Research at the Indiana University School of Medicine to analyze transgenic zebrafish to develop ROS biosensor to monitor organ damage in zebrafish model of diabetes. The goal of the research was to help aid future development of therapies to prevent diabetic complications
