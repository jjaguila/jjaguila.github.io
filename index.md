Our team worked on analyzing how social inequality impacts COVID-19 vaccination rates in the US. By collecting data from multiple sources and testing 3 different models, we were able to determine that the Random Forest Regressor was the most accurate model to predict vaccination rates. We discussed how these findings can be used to provide better care to specific communities.
